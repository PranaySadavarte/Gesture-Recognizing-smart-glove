# Gesture-Recognizing-smart-glove
● Designed a microcontroller circuit that recognizes hand gestures made by glove with embedded
flex sensors, and translates them into speech and text using peripheral interface controller (PIC)
● Used APR9600 record/replay IC to associate the input gesture to the appropriate recorded voice
sample from its flash analogue storage exhibiting high quality speech output
● Focussed on simplifying the conversation process amongst the differently abled (deaf and dumb)
